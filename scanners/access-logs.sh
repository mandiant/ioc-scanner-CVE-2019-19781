# here's a great example of a write-once, read-never regex!
# so, lets explain how it works:
#
# we want to match successful requests in web server access logs containing paths like:
#
#    /vpns/portal/12345678.xml
#    /vpn/../vpns/portal/12345678.xml
#
# these paths can be URL encoded, so we also match that.
#
# [GET or POST] [space] [any url prefix] /vpns/ [any url fragment].xml [space] HTTP/1.1" [space] [200 or 304]
#                                         ^^^^ maybe encoded
success_regexes[0]="(GET|POST)\s[^\s]*/(v|%76)(p|%70)(n|%6[Ee])(s|%73)/[^\s]*\.xml\sHTTP/1\.1\"\s(200|304)";
success_regexes[1]="(GET|POST)\s[^\s]*/(v|%76)(p|%70)(n|%6[Ee])(s|%73)/[^\s]*\.pl\sHTTP/1\.1\"\s304"

# there are other patterns that can be effective at finding scanning and exploitation.
# however, we're not convinced that they won't FP on simple scanning.
# right now, this script is specifically focusing on high confidence indicators of compromise.
# please see the discussion in the readme about our philosophy here.
#
# find success requests to perl scripts.
# we are not sure if there are any legitimate uses for this URL extension.
# we are not sure if this will flag on simple scanning.

# find directory traversal.
# we suspect this will flag on simple scanning.
